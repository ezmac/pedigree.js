# pedigree.js

Pedigree.js is a small tool that I have created to automate some of the tedious task of creating a fictional family tree for characters.

## what it is

It's a random generator that creates fictional lineages for new characters so the author doesn't have to waste effort trying to come up with combinations. By offloading things to the generator, authors can hopefully create characters free of bias or characters who might not otherwise be chosen by authors.

## what it is not

This is not stable software. Anything prior to a 1.0.0 release should be considered to be pre-alpha software that you use at your own risk. 

In addition, this is not and will never be an actual genealogical tool.

## features

Here are a list of proposed features that I would like to see included in pedigree.js
